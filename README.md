# babyblocks-ts

Simple Typescript Showcase for BLOCKS generation. 

The idea is to re-use the sources from the [ISI-CWIC](https://github.com/ybisk/ISI-CWIC/) client app to generate images that appear nearly the same as in the [BLOCKS dataset](https://groundedlanguage.github.io/) since I was not able to get the original application up and running.

For now there is only a hard-coded example of block states in `sample-states.ts` that show the generation of an example world.
